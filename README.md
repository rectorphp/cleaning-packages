# Cleaning Packages in one Metapackage

This repository contains a collection of cleaning packages for PHP projects, that take code quality to the next level.

...and are lazy to automate as much work as possible.

They're collection of CLI tools and PHPStan extensions (some of them you can find in detail in [tomasvotruba.com/tools](https://tomasvotruba.com/tools).

## Install

```bash
composer require rector/cleaning-packages --dev
```

Happy coding!
