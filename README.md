# All Cleaning Packages in one Place

This repository contains a collection of cleaning packages for PHP devs, who want to take code quality to the next level...

...and are enough lazy to delegate as much work as possible to automated tools.

<br>

It's a collection of CLI tools and PHPStan extensions (some of them you can find in [tomasvotruba.com/tools](https://tomasvotruba.com/tools)).

<br>

## Install

```bash
composer require rector/cleaning-packages --dev
```

<br>

Happy coding!
